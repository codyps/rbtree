= RBTREE =

The rbtree implimentation from the linux kernel, with filtering applied to
allow it to be used in userspace when combined with ccan (just for
container_of())

For usage, see rbtree.txt (keep in mind that it is written towards the kernel impl)

== Bugs ==

 - *.version files are empty.
 - don't have full git history for the imported files.
 - external deps suck.
